# myZoom
This project is a simple implementation of Zoom (a lame imitation ......), just an assignment.

# Goal

Zoom and Microsoft Teams are widely used as a method for large groups of people to hold online virtual meetings. A good example is the online Zoom lectures used for various courses at UNSW. In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to implement your own version of an online video conferencing and messaging application. Your application is based on a client-server model consisting of one server and multiple clients communicating concurrently. The text messages should be communicated using TCP for the reason of reliability, while the video (you will use video files instead of capturing the live video streams from cameras and microphones) should be communicated using UDP for the reason of low latency. Your application will support a range of functions that are typically found on videoconferencing including authentication, broadcasting text messages to all participants, building a separate room for part of the participants, and uploading video streams (i.e., files in this assignment). You will be designing custom application protocols based on TCP and UDP.
